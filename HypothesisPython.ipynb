It is a point on the distribution that is compared with the test statistic to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or no. If the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than the critical value, we declare statistical significance and reject the null hypothesis. It is calculated using the significance level(α). Now, what is the significance level? It determines the % risk of the decision taken. We always reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis with some kind of confidence level. For example, we can say that we rejected the null hypothesis with 95% confidence, then the significance level(α) will be 1–0.95 = 0.05.
